### Making enticing visualizations to display our findings from Machine learning models and spread awareness
  
We have identified several problems:

- Mosquito borne diseases cause millions of deaths annually
- Deforestation is accelerating, despite mounting efforts against it
- Slow rate of adoption of solar energy due to economic factors
- Inefficient farming practices lead to low yield and resource wastage
  
Our Solutions are based on intuitive details and intricate visualizations. We have also considered creative solutions based on Machine learning models.

### Problem 1: The Mosquito Attack
### Problem 2: Preventing Forest fires
### Problem 3: Adoption of Solar solutions
### Problem 4: Better farming practices

Solutions for the problem statements:

- Mosquito Attack: Using K-Means Clustering to track Malaria and Zika virus spread across the globe
- Preventing Forest fires: Using Convolutional Neural Networks to predict forest fires and take steps to mitigate its effects
- Adoption of Solar solutions: Using Monte Carlo simulations and curve fitting (Normalization) to visualize solar adoption using a solar power usage calculator
- Better farming solutions: Using GeoCharts to visualize prime cash crops and mapping a profitable supply chain maximizing profits
